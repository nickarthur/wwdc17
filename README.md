# WWDC17
This is my winning submission for the WWDC 2017 Scholarship. I utilised UIKit and SceneKit to create a realisic model of the solar system, allowing the user to fly through the model exploring the different planets. Each planet presents a card giving more information about the size, distance from the sun etc. which can be triggered by iterating through each planet using swipe gestures. 

Elements of AVFoundation were used to add sound effects to the playground, creating a more emersive experience. 

Resources used were as follows:
